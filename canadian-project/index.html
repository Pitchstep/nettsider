            <p class="section-sub">A diverse and welcoming land of opportunity and stunning natural beauty.</p>
            <p>English-speaking Canada, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific and up to the Arctic, encompasses a vast tapestry of landscapes. From the bustling metropolitan hub of Toronto to the mountainous Pacific coast of Vancouver and the quiet, rugged coastlines of the Maritimes, every region offers a unique experience. While English is the primary working language across nine provinces and three territories, the nation prides itself on its official bilingualism and deep-rooted multiculturalism, making it a vibrant mosaic of global cultures and traditions.</p>
            <p>The shared history of Indigenous peoples, French and British colonization, and subsequent waves of global immigration have shaped a national identity characterized by politeness, a love of hockey, and a deep appreciation for the outdoors. Canada consistently ranks as one of the best places in the world to live, known for its high quality of life, strong healthcare system, and political stability.</p>

            <ul class="detail-list">
              <li>
                <strong>National Animals:</strong> Canada officially recognizes two national animals: the North American Beaver (symbolizing hard work and sovereignty) and the majestic Canadian Horse (symbolizing strength and endurance).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>National Flower/Tree:</strong> While there is no official national flower, the **Maple Leaf** is the undisputed national symbol, prominently featured on the flag. The Maple tree's leaf, particularly the Sugar Maple, is celebrated for its role in making **Maple Syrup**.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Endemic Species:</strong> Very few species are strictly native to Canada alone, but certain unique populations thrive here. The **Vancouver Island Marmot** is one of the world's rarest mammals, found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Another significant species is the **Boreal Woodland Caribou**, a unique subspecies whose survival is tightly linked to Canada's vast, untouched boreal forests.

            <ul class="detail-list">
              <li>
                <strong>National Motto and Symbol:</strong> Canada's official motto is in Latin: **"A mari usque ad mare"** which translates to **"From Sea to Sea"**. This motto reflects the breadth of the country, stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. The Crown is the central element of Canada's coat of arms and symbolizes the constitutional monarchy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Political System:</strong> Canada operates as a Federal Parliamentary Democracy and a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is the reigning Canadian monarch (currently King Charles III), represented by the Governor General. The head of government is the **Prime Minister**, who leads the country based on the support of the House of Commons. Political power is divided between the federal, provincial, and territorial governments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Historical Event: Confederation (1867):</strong> The most important historical event was the creation of the Dominion of Canada through the British North America Act in 1867. This landmark legislation united three British North American colonies (the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick) into one federation, marking the birth of Canada as a self-governing entity and setting the stage for its westward expansion.

            <p class="section-sub">Discover what makes the Canadian spirit unique.</p>
            <p>Canadian culture is defined by its deep commitment to pluralism, diversity, and community. Key cultural touchstones extend beyond stereotypes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hockey: Considered the national winter sport, it is a source of immense national pride and community identity, dominating media coverage and social gatherings throughout the winter.</li>
              <li>Tim Hortons: A quintessential Canadian coffee and donut chain. It is far more than a restaurant; it’s a national institution, integral to daily commutes, road trips, and casual gatherings.</li>
              <li>Politeness: Canadians are internationally known for their friendly and often self-deprecating nature. Saying "sorry" is often a simple conversational filler, not always an admission of guilt!</li>
              <li>Arts and Media: Canada has produced globally influential artists, musicians (like The Weeknd, Drake, and Joni Mitchell), and filmmakers. Cities like Toronto and Vancouver host vibrant, multicultural arts scenes, festivals, and independent film studios.</li>
              <li>Poutine: While originating in Quebec (French-speaking), this dish of French fries and cheese curds topped with brown gravy is a beloved national comfort food.</li>

            <ul class="detail-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Currency:</strong> The Canadian Dollar (CAD). Credit cards and digital payments are widely accepted, especially in urban areas. Tipping (15-20%) is standard practice for most sit-down service staff.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Weather:</strong> Prepare for extremes. Summers can be quite hot, especially in the interior, but winters (especially inland and northern regions) are famously cold and require heavy, layered gear.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Taxes:</strong> Prices displayed on shelves generally do not include the sales tax (GST/HST), which varies significantly by province (from 5% to 15%). Be prepared for the final price at the till to be higher.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Distance:</strong> Canada is geographically vast. Plan travel between major cities using flights, as driving from, say, Toronto to Vancouver, can take a full week.
